          In today&#39;s fast-paced world, various demographic groups face unique challenges that can
significantly impact their quality of life. Women often juggle multiple roles, balancing work
and family responsibilities, which can lead to stress
and health issues, Women also have safety concern
nowadays. Elders frequently encounter mobility
limitations and health concerns that restrict their
independence, making it difficult for them to engage
in daily activities. Corporate workers are under constant pressure to meet deadlines, leading
to burnout and a lack of work-life balance. Teenagers, on the other hand, grapple with
academic pressures and social challenges that can affect their mental health. To address these
pressing issues, we present the Rescue Ranger Band, a smart care band designed to
leverage technology for enhanced well-being. This innovative device integrates
computational thinking principles to provide real-time health monitoring and emergency
assistance. Equipped with features such as heart rate tracking, fall detection, and emergency
alerts, the Rescue Ranger empowers users to take control of their health while ensuring
immediate support in critical situations. By harnessing the power of science and technology,
the Rescue Ranger not only aims to improve individual health outcomes but also fosters a
sense of community and safety among users. As we explore the intersection of technology
and healthcare, our project embodies the theme &quot;Science and Technology for Future,&quot;
showcasing how computational thinking can lead to practical solutions that enhance
everyday life for women, elders, corporate workers, and teenagers alike.
